# Builds the pinned Ghostty libghostty-vt static archive. This script is the
# native build contract of go-tui-frame: the justfile's native recipes run it,
# and consumers run the copy in the go-tui-frame module their go.mod selects:
#
#   go mod download github.com/alexgorbatchev/go-tui-frame/v2
#   frame=$(go list -m -f '{{.Dir}}' github.com/alexgorbatchev/go-tui-frame/v2)
#   bash "$frame/scripts/native.sh" ROOT TARGET PREFIX CACHE
#
# Run it with bash: the module cache keeps files read-only and without their
# executable bit.
#
# ROOT is the absolute output directory. TARGET is the Zig target, such as
# native or x86_64-linux-musl. PREFIX and CACHE name the installation and Zig
# cache directories relative to ROOT. The script writes only under ROOT, never
# next to itself, and prints the archive's pkg-config flags when it finishes.
